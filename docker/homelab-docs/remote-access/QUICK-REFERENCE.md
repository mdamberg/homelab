## 🏠 When You're At Home

### Option 1: Use Local IPs (Faster)

When connected to home WiFi, you can use local IPs for faster access:

```
http://10.0.0.7:8181         # Homarr
http://10.0.0.7:8123         # Home Assistant
http://10.0.0.7:32400/web    # Plex
```

### Option 2: Use Tailscale IPs (Always Works)

Or just always use Tailscale IPs - they work at home AND away:

```
http://100.82.35.70:8181     # Works everywhere!
```

## 📋 Troubleshooting Checklist

### Services Won't Load?

- [ ] Is Tailscale ON? (Check app icon/status)
- [ ] Using correct IP? (`100.82.35.70`, not `10.0.0.7`)
- [ ] Using correct port? (See table above)
- [ ] Is server online? (Green dot in Tailscale app device list)
- [ ] Try a different service to isolate the issue

### Tailscale Won't Connect?

- [ ] Internet connection working?
- [ ] Try restarting Tailscale app
- [ ] Try logging out and back in
- [ ] Check Tailscale status: https://status.tailscale.com/

### Slow Performance?

- [ ] Check your cellular/WiFi signal strength
- [ ] Try accessing from different network
- [ ] Large files (like video) use your home upload bandwidth
- [ ] Consider using lower quality for streaming

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Bookmark These URLs

**On Phone:**
- Add bookmarks to Safari/Chrome for quick access
- Or save to home screen for app-like experience

**On Laptop:**
- Bookmark bar: Homarr, Plex, Home Assistant
- Or use Homarr as your starting point (it has links to everything)

### Use Homarr as Your Hub

- Homarr (http://100.82.35.70:8181) has links to all services
- Just bookmark Homarr, access everything from there
- Cleaner than remembering all the URLs

### Battery Considerations

**Tailscale uses minimal battery when idle, but:**
- Turn it OFF when not needed
- Or use "on-demand" activation (in Tailscale settings)
- iOS/Android will manage it efficiently

### Device IPs Quick Reference

| Device | Local IP | Tailscale IP | When to Use |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Server** | 10.0.0.7 | 100.82.35.70 | - |
| **Your Phone** | 10.0.0.20 | 100.94.112.76 | - |

**Rule of thumb:**
- At home: Use `10.0.0.7` (faster)
- Away: Use `100.82.35.70` (only option)
- Not sure: Use `100.82.35.70` (always works)

## 📞 Emergency Access

### If Tailscale Fails

1. **At Home:**
   - Use local IPs: http://10.0.0.7:xxxx
   - Direct WiFi access always works

2. **Away from Home:**
   - Check Tailscale status: https://status.tailscale.com/
   - Try restarting app
   - Check internet connection
   - Last resort: Wait until you get home

### If Server Goes Down

- **Can't access anything remotely**
- Need physical access to restart server
- Or set up Wake-on-LAN for remote restarts (future project)
